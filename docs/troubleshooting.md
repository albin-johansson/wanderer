# Wanderer troubleshooting

This document provides instructions for dealing with possible issues that might arise when trying to Run Wanderer.

## There are black margins around the game viewport

If you're using a 16:9 monitor then this is likely solved by overriding the DPI-scaling settings for the executable in Windows. Alternatively, you can also try changing the "Integer scaling" option in the settings menu.

1. Navigate to the Wanderer executable.
1. Right-click the executable, select the `Properties` item.
1. Select the `Compatibility` tab.
1. In the `Settings` group, press the `Change high DPI settings` button.
1. In the `High DPI scaling override` group, enable the `Override high DPI scaling behaviour` checkbox.
1. Select the `Application` item in the dropdown.
1. That's it! The scaling should now be fixed the next time you Run the game.
