/**
 * \class game_base
 *
 * \brief The base class for all game class implementations.
 *
 * \details You should derive your game class from this class, which you then supply to
 * your engine instance.
 *
 * \details The following example illustrates a skeleton for a game using the Rune
 * framework. Note, no virtual functions are pure, i.e. you only have to override the
 * functions that you need in your own game class.
 *
 * \note Whilst this class is stateless and default-constructible, the `engine` class
 * expects game classes to be either default-constructible or constructible from a
 * reference to a graphics context.
